# password-database-version-GUI
This is a GUI version the password database i have previously created.

After getting all my friends a family to test the Terminal version,
alot of the feedback i got was that they would prefer a GUI version instead of the termoinal version.
And since this projects purpose is to get me to learn and become a better programmer i decided to make GUI version.

What is complete and what is not?
Complete:
  * Login system
    * User creation
    * User authentication
  * Password generator
  * Pincode generator
  * Encryption key generator
  * File encrypter
  * File decrypter

Not complete:
  * The database
  * How to window
  * Individual user databases

Future plans?
Altough i have not yet completly finished this version yet, i am going to begin creation a of third version.
This new version will build upon the Terminal version.
The new version is going to be a "webapp"?, i recently relised when i tried to login to an account on my phone,
that i only had accses to the database when i am at homw with my computer. Which is a problem since i use my accounts on multiple devices.
And so i came up with the idea of creating a Website for the database.

Here are some pictures from the program:
